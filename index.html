                    <h2>Driven by Passion</h2>
                    <p>I've taken a long hard moment to really think about what legacy that I want to leave behind. For me, I have an undying love for creating ideas. I also love the relief videogames can provide for someone going through tough times. Although I come from a decent background, 
                        I have had my own personal moments of darkness that have taken me almost out of the game of life. It was in these moments, it was my family and the things that I was passionate about that kept me going. This inspired me to believe that my purpose in life is to create videogames for people
                        who are struggling in the world. Although this belief might not always translate to most common jobs in IT, I will do whatever it takes to gain supplementary design skills, front-end development skills, and any other important information to reach my goal.</p>
                    <h2>Driven to Create Impact</h2>
                    <p>As just mentioned, I want to create videogames that can provide mental relief and entertain others who want to have fun. This desire that I have for my goal also reflects the person that I aspire to be. For personal connections, I like to be down-to-earth and friendly towards anyone that shows me the same respect.
                        From a communication standpoint, I like to be in-person and upfront about my motivations rather than virtual and vague. A wise man once said, "Honesty is the best policy" and its a quote that I try to take to heart.
